# Cheeb Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This project is your very own cheeb generator. You can turn any word you like into a "cheebified" word. 

This was just for fun and is really an inside joke more than anything. But I still wanted to share my creation with the world.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
